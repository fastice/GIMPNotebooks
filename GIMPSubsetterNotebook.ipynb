For the Sentinel based velocity mosaics (0725, 0727, 0731), the user can select a box on a map and select which components to be downloaded (vv, vx, vy, ex, ey, dT) and saved to a netCDF file. Once the download is complete, users can [explore](#Visualizing-the-Data) the data by interactively selecting points that are plotted as time series. In the case of the TSX products (NSDIC-0481), given their small size, the full product \"box\" is downloaded. Because of the sparse nature of these boxes, only the the products associated with a single box can be downloaded at a time."
