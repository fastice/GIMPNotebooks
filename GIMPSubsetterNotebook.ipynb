For the Sentinel-based velocity mosaics (0725, 0727, 0731), a user can select a box on a map and choose which components are downloaded (vv, vx, vy, ex, ey, dT) and saved to a netCDF file. Once the download is complete, users can [explore](#Visualizing-the-Data) the data by interactively selecting points that are plotted as time series. In the case of the TSX products (NSDIC-0481), given relatively small size of each box (~50-km-by-50-km), the full product \"box\" is downloaded. Because of the sparse nature of these boxes, only the the products associated with a single box can be downloaded at a time."

Here we also take advantage of [rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io/rioxarray/stable/), which builds on xarray to add the ability to append coordinate reference system [CRS](https://proj.org/faq.html#what-is-the-best-format-for-describing-coordinate-reference-systems) information.

These programs also utilize [dask](https://dask.org/) to perform parallel operations, which can greatly speed data access. The main focus of this notebook is on subsetting the data rather than working with the downloaded result. A subsequent notebook will provide examples of working with xarray data in greater detail.
