This Notebook will set up that authentication so that the process happens automatically when a Notebook or QGIS try to access those files. In particular, it will create a cookie file (`.gimp_download_cookiejar.txt`) in the user's home directory that *GDAL* (one of the installed packages) uses to redirect the login appropriately for remote file access. It also creates a new or appends to an existing `.netrc` file in the user's home directory to include the login id and password (see security risks below). In principle, this notebook should only need to be run once to set thes files up, but can be rerun if needed. Further steps outlined below are required for programs to use this information."
