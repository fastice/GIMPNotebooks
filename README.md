# GIMPNotebooks
Notebooks for working with Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) data archived at NSIDC

## NSIDCLoginNotebook.ipynb
This notebook creates a cookie file and .netrc file with authentication information that GDAL based programs (e.g., other Notebooks in this repo and *QGIS*) can download /vsicurl links to allow remote access of data archive at NSDIC. The notebook contains full setup instructions. Users should view the notebook on github before trying to run.

The directions for setup are contained in the notebook, so its a good idea to read the github rendered notebook before proceeding.
