    "Browsing a single remote product at time can be remarkably fast even with a home connection. But remote access does have its drawbacks. In particular, the time it takes QGIS to load scales with the number of products since the program must verify each product by reading its header information. For 300 products this can take anywhere from 45 seconds to more than 5 minutes. As a result, its not generally a good idea to include too many products in a project. For a partial mitigation of this problem, see working with layer definition files below. Peformance can be improved greatly by downloading the data, at the expense of having to store it locally. See TBD Notebook for searching and downloading data.\n",
