    "This noteboook allows users to search for and select [GIMP](https://nsidc.org/data/measures/gimp) products in the [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/) archive to build a [*QGIS*](https://qgis.org/en/site/) project file that allows browsing of the remote data at NSIDC. Once the appropriate steps for authentication have been executed (see [**NSIDCLoginNotebook**](https://github.com/fastice/GIMPNotebooks/blob/master/NSIDCLoginNotebook.ipynb)), the resulting [*QGIS*](https://qgis.org/en/site/) project can be opened to display products located remotely at NSIDC. The GIMP products are stored as Cloud Optimized Geotiffs ([COGs](https://www.cogeo.org/)), which allows relatively fast display even over slow internet connections. Remote access through QGIS is often more convenient  than downloading the full data sets, some of which exceed 1TB.

    "Browsing a single remote product at time can be remarkably fast even with a home connection due the efficient access possible with the [COG](https://www.cogeo.org/) format. But remote access does have its drawbacks. In particular, the time it takes QGIS to load when it starts up scales with the number of products since the program must verify each product by reading its header information. For 300 products this can take anywhere from 45 seconds to more than 5 minutes, depending on network speed. As a result, its not generally a good idea to include too many products in a project. For a partial mitigation of this problem, see working with layer definition files below. To debug a problem opening QGIS files, create a project with only a few files so that it will time out more quickly if there is an authentication problem ([**NSIDCLoginNotebook**](https://github.com/fastice/GIMPNotebooks/blob/master/NSIDCLoginNotebook.ipynb)). See also these pre-built [projects](https://github.com/fastice/GIMPQGISProjects).\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to network limitations, problems can occur when too many images are selected as visible (checked) at once so that QGIS tries to render them all simultaneously. This situation can cause network errors, especially if the number of NDIDC connections (15) is exceeded. To avoid such problems, the automatically generated *QGIS* projects have most of the layers unchecked at first. As best practice, avoid **Check All and Its Children** in *QGIS* unless there only a handful of products. Since generally only one or a few products can be viewed at once, navigate to the product of interest, check it to view it, then uncheck when moving to a different product (a few images can viewed simulaneously - for example to flicker pairs of images).\n",
    "\n",
    "When network errors occur, an image may not render properly. If this occurs, uncheck excess images, then zoom in and out, which will trigger a reload that usually will re-render the image correctly (the error flag next to the product may persist even after the image loads correctly)."
